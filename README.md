# Python Discord Information Grabbing Tool
This is a tool that I made because I was bored. In this .md file there will be a tutorial on how to actually host this and trick some of your friends or something
_If you have any stuff to ask, DM me on Discord (@internetbeloved_
## Features
• Gives Public information (Username, Hostname, Public IP, etc.)
• Some computer specifications (CPU count, CPU, Total RAM, Disk Usage, etc.)
• Extra stuff (Network, Boot Time, Geolocation, External IP, etc.)
• Editable stuff (this is open-sourced)
## How to actually make this work
Firstly, you will need the source. Go to the repository and download the source ZIP folder or go to the versions tab and download it from there.
After, you must also download Python 3.13 or whatever version. (Python 3.13 works best, as I programmed it with Python 3.13) Go to [https://python.org](the Python official website) and download it from there.

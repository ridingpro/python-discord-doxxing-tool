# Python Discord Information Grabbing Tool
This is a tool that I made because I was bored. In this .md file there will be a tutorial on how to actually host this and trick some of your friends or something
_If you have any stuff to ask, DM me on Discord (@internetbeloved_
## Features
• Gives Public information (Username, Hostname, Public IP, etc.)
• Some computer specifications (CPU count, CPU, Total RAM, Disk Usage, etc.)
• Extra stuff (Network, Boot Time, Geolocation, External IP, etc.)
• Editable stuff (this is open-sourced)
